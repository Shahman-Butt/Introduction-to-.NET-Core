.Net Core is open-source, cross-platform, has a modular architecture to develop the web applications,
 supports multiple languages, and target multiple frameworks. Consistent, gives a high support of CLI tools,
  flexible deployment, and has a compatibility with different OS and programming languages

Introduction to ASP.NET Core
ASP.NET Core is a free and open-source web framework and successor to ASP.NET,developed by Microsoft.
 It is a modular framework that runs on both the full .NET Framework, on Windows, and the cross-platform

 .NET Framework:

 Windows Forms Applications
 WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) Applications -- 2.0-4.8

 Web Applications:
 ASP.NET Web Forms Applications
 ASP.NET MVC Applications
 ASP.NET Web API

 Services:
Windows Services
WCF (Windows Communication Foundation) Services --  2.0-4.8
LINQ -- 2.0-4.8


ASP.NET VS ASP.NET CORE:
 
The most important difference is the platform support. ASP.NET is built for Windows,
 where ASP.NET Core runs on Windows, Mac and Linux operating system. ASP.NET is based on .NET Framework, 
 but ASP.NET Core has all the features like dependency injection, request response pipelines and middlewares
  introduced in .Net Core to improvise your web or internet based application. In ASP.NET we have a less control
   over the dependencies, where in
ASP.NET Core strict control over the dependencies with the high scalability iterations are there. 
Where in ASP.NET Core we do not have support for Global.asax or Web config, they are far better and replaced 
with appsettings.JSON. ASP.NET gives us support to the components like WebForms, MVC and Web API as well.
 But in ASP.NET Core, we have a MVC support, WebAPI, Razor pages and Blazzors. ASP.NET is supported by all the 
 versions of Visual Studio, 
where ASP.NET Core is supported with the latest version from 2015, 2017 onwards and latest is 2022.
